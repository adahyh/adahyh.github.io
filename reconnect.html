      <h2>Overview</h2>
        ReConnect was created as a project for my Usability and Information Architecture 
        class at UCSD. My team and I were challenged with creating a product for those with 
        hemispatial neglect (HSN) incorporating the use of virtual reality (VR) technology. 
        <br><br>
        After pitching ReConnect in our class' shark tank competition, my team placed second 
        and was voted first in the categories of "Most Impactful Solution",
        "Most Clearly Addressing the Problem", and "Most Interesting to have Future Development".

    <br> <br>

    <!-- problem section -->
    <div class="body-text">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      795,000 people suffer from a stroke in the United States annually, and this number 
      is expected to increase 20% by 2030. Stroke is the leading cause of serious 
      long-term disability like HSN, which targets the ages 60+ the hardest. HSN causes 
      a lack of awareness of one side of the visual field and body, often the left side. 
      They may ignore the buttons on the left side of their shirt, or have trouble seeing 
      objects in their left field of vision. 
      <br> <br>
      Additionally, social isolation in stroke survivors is common, and family and friends 
      do not know how to support their loved one. There can also be friction when reaching 
      out after long periods of no contact, which makes connecting even more difficult.

    <br>

    <div class="body-text">
      Our team asked ourselves:

      How might we provide specific answers and resources for someone who may not know what they are looking for?

          Negami is an augmented reality game which can be used at home for those with 
          HSN. This is done through using visual cues to guide truncal rotations,

          This musical game was created as part of a study on HSN. It is played in a 
          hospital setting under guidance, and promotes memory and motor coordination 
          through auditory and motor cues. <b>We want to create a game that can be

    <!-- solution section -->
    <div class="body-text">
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      Our team aimed to provide a platform for family and friends to find ways to 
      connect with their loved ones who have HSN through the multiplayer game, ReConnect. 
      ReConnect let;s stroke patients bond with their friends and family during recovery, 
      no matter the distance. Loved ones can chat and interact with patients in-game, while 
      playing games that incorporate behavioral therapy to treat HSN. In game, the players 
      can revisit old memories, and view content submitted by other family and friends who 
      are not playing, but want to show their support. 
      <br><br>
      Reconnect wasn't just a game, but a gateway to connect loved ones.

    </div>
    <br> <br>

    <!-- ideation section -->
    <div class="body-text">
      <h2>Ideation</h2>
      We moved forward with two main goals in mind:
      <b><ol>
        <li>Create a easy way to connect over any distance.</li>
        <li>Use technology as a means to connect different age groups, instead of it being a barrier.</li>
      </ol></b>
      
      
      We started with defining what the gameplay would be like. We kept HSN therapy 
      techniques in mind, and thought of ways we could embed them so patients could 
      practice and then transfer these techniques over to their daily lives.
      <br><br>
      
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">
          We landed on the concept of recreating a HSN patient's room in VR, where they 
          would search for objects that would trigger mini-games. These games would 
          incorporate aspects such as neglected limb movement and truncal rotations, and 
          completing them would present the player with photos and videos of their loved 
          ones. Additionally, a loved one could watch the player's game and provide support 
          through a text chat.

      User Testing

    <div class="body-text">

      We then conducted user testing, with 13 of our classmates testing our concept: 11 
      on the user end and 2 on the loved one end. We wanted to focus on how that experience 
      would feel like, rather than focusing on the visuals. 
      <br><br>
      We created a paper prototype of the games a stroke patient would play in VR, 
      setting up the "room" around them using paper furniture. Users testing the patient 
      end wore a box that blocked their left field of vision to emulate the struggles a 
      player with HSN might have. The app for the loved one's end was recreated through 
      slido, used as a live chat feature where friends could provide support on their progress, 
      and through clapping and cheering in person after the completion of our three minigames.

            <b>Solution:</b>

          <span>
            Make ReConnect a multiplayer game. Loved ones can provide support throughout 
            the game, making the social aspects more prevalent. Additionally, create features 
            in the partner app where other family and friends can submit videos, pictures, 
            or audios that are delivered to the patient.

            The use of the live text chat was not effective for building connections. </b>
            <br>
            Some users were unaware that their family member was leaving comments 
            until the whole game finished. This could be due to the computer screen being 
            out of view, or the user being immersed in the game where the text could 
            not gain their attention.

          <span class="highlight-text">
            <b>Solution:</b>
          </span> 
          <span>
            Connect players through a voice chat. Interaction is more built in, and will 
            be more obvious. Rather than confining communication to text messages, loved ones
            have the option to use emotes or reactions to help convey emotions and aid connections.

          Loved ones first select a pose, and the pose is sent over to the HSN player in VR. 
          The player would move their limbs to match the pose, which are tracked using the 
          hand controllers. They are provided visual feedback following their movement and 
          showing how accurate they are, and haptic prompts from the hand controllers.

          When an HSN player begins to play, their loved ones receive a notification 
          prompting them to submit a video message for encouragement or support. They 
          can quickly open the app, read the day's prompt, and send their submission. 
          This simple action allows them to be an active part of the player's journey, 
          sharing moments of connection and motivation, even if they're not directly playing the game.

      <br><br>
      In VR, once the player opens the door at the end of the level, a screen with 
      the prompt for the day will come up, where the player can look through the videos 
      submitted by their loved ones, experiencing heartfelt messages, encouraging moments, 
      and shared memories, which would reinforce the sense of connection and support throughout 
      their journey.

      If the project were to be continued, we would want to develop more features and 
      expand the reach to aid more patients with other conditions, not just HSN. 
      This would involve diversifying games, focusing on different treatments and 
      continuing to take inspiration from current therapy techniques. This would 
      also involve implementing new methods of measurements depending on the condition. 
      <br><br>
      Additionally, we would aim to expand the gameplay for larger groups to be able to incoporate more loved ones. 
      <br><br>
      If ReConnect were to be implemented as a functional game, we would also want to monitor and 
      measure social isolation changes in the users. This would include:
      <br><br>

      <ul>
        <li>Quantitative Data</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Number of times played with a loved one</li>
          <li>Number of chats and video messages sent (checking consistency)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Qualitative Data</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Surveys asking about satisfaction and strength of connection</li>
        </ul>

    <br>

    <div class="body-text">
      This class and project emphasized design and ideation, rather than implementation.
      I'm grateful to have the opportunity to create something without being restrained 
      to what my team could make functional, as many of us had not had experience creating 
      games before. This project pushed me to think out of the box and create a solution 
      in a way that had not been done before. 
      <br><br>
      Additionally, this was my first time something for VR. I've always wanted to try 
      3D modeling, and this project was a great way to get exposure and learn from my peers.
