      <h2>Overview</h2>
        For a project for UC San Diego's Global TIES program, my team and I partnered with
        the non-profit My MenoPlan to create an empathetic AI chatbot and resource. Our 
        goal was to make a mobile website called Menolearn that could provide information 
        and support through the chatbot and other resources, such as research papers and other women's stories. 
    </div>
    <br> <br>

    <!-- problem section -->
    <div class="body-text">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
        While My MenoPlan had several resources on their website, such as information on 
        medication and videos sharing different experiences, these were not showcased in 
        an easily accessible way. While information was present, it was not easy to find 
        answers, especially for someone who might be confused about their journey in menopause. 
    </div>
    <br>

    <div class="body-text">
      Our team asked ourselves: 
    </div>
    <br>

    <div class="body-text emphasized-text">
      How might we provide specific answers and resources for someone who may not know what they are looking for?
    </div>
    <div class="body-text emphasized-text">
      How might we present information about a stigmatized topic so that users may feel supported and understood?
    </div>
    <br> <br>

    <!-- solution section -->
    <div class="body-text">
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      Our solution was to redesign the website to reorganize their information architecture 
      and create a welcoming and empathetic environment, as well as integrating a chatbot 
      feature. This would be designed by my team, the Menolearn Interaction Design Team, 
      and would be passed on to the Menolearn WebDev team to bring the designs to reality.

    <div class="body-text">
      <h2>Research</h2>

    <div class="body-text sub-header">
      Interviews and Qualitative Analysis
    </div>
    
    <div class="body-text">
      Four groups were interviewed: Doctors, Nurses, Medical Students and General Public. 
      During these interviews, we asked individuals to share their education on menopause 
      and also their personal experiences with menopause or their experiences supporting 
      friends or family through it. 
      <br> <br>

      We then created transcripts of these interviews to conduct qualitative analysis to 
      determine what women felt like they lacked during their menopause or what they 
      would find valuable. Some common themes included:
      <br> <br>

        <ul>
          <li>Wanting discussion or conversation, rather than simply answers</li>
          <li>Feeling as if their experiences were not of importance to others</li>
          <li>Confusion due to a lack of information</li>
          <li>Wanting alternatives such as natural remedies</li>
        </ul>
        
        From these themes, we created user personas to better understand who Menolearn would be for.
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4">
            <img src="images/menolearn/meno-persona-1.png" alt="user persona" class="img-fluid">
          </div>
  
          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4">
            <img src="images/menolearn/meno-persona-2.png" alt="user persona" class="img-fluid">
          </div>
  
          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4">
            <img src="images/menolearn/meno-persona-3.png" alt="user persona" class="img-fluid">
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <br><br>
        These themes drove the design, further emphasizing how important it was to 
        create a conversational space where women would feel heard and validated while 
        receiving correct information on menopause.  
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <!-- ideation section -->
    <div class="body-text">
      <h2>Ideation</h2>
      It was important for my team to start with designing the chatbot, as this was the 
      main feature of Menolearn. We collaborated with the Machine Learning Team to 
      determine what would be achievable in terms of features and answers that the chatbot 
      could provide. We started with sketches and low-fidelity mockups so we could start 
      to envision the design, but clearly define what features we wanted to be included. 
      The design was critiques and iterated on until it reached our first high fidelity prototype. 
    </div>
    <br>

          </div>
      </div>
      <br>

      After evaluating this prototype, we felt that while we were satisfied with the 
      concept and functionality, it did not capture the empathetic essence that we were 
      aiming to create. It was not as visually appealing or welcoming as we wanted it to be. 
      From here, the interaction design team split into two sub teams, each creating their 
      own new design for the same key features and pages. My team's design was ultimately 
      chosen for the final design, the whole team we then regrouped together to put finishing 
      touches on.

      It was important for us to create a chatbot with different answering options, 
      such as multiple choice or selection. This was done to reduce confusion (e.g. 
      a user does not know how to answer because they are uninformed on the topic) and 
      reduce the effort it takes for them to use the chat bot (e.g. if they have multiple 
      symptoms that they are experiencing, or if they are interested in multiple remedies).

      Original resources from the My MenoPlan site were retained, such as the “Am I in

      presented as part of the onboarding process so the user's menopausal stage can guide 
      the content presented.

      In June, my team and I presented Menolearn to our stakeholders and community members. 
      The WebDev team was able to implement the chatbot design, and the Machine Learning 
      team had trained the chatbot on menopause information and research, so the chatbot 
      was able to respond to specific prompts accurately. 
      <br><br>

      I hope to continue working on the team, rejoining as part of the WebDev team. While 
      I have experience with HTML/CSS/JS, I am furthering my knowledge through taking additional 
      courses in front-end development. 
      <br><br>

      After implementing more of the Menolearn so that other features including the chatbot are 
      usable, usability testing would be conducted to test ensure our goals of providing easily 
      accessible information in a supportive manner.
