      <h2>Overview</h2>
      This project was made for COGS 123: Social Computing, a course at UC San Diego. 
      My team and I sought to explore the intersection between social behavior and 
      computational systems. This was done through creating a social computing 
      experience that the students could participate in, and we decided to create 
      TicketTasker: a way to bring together music festival volunteers who might 
      attend by themselves, and hope to make friends with like-minded individuals 
      who want to give back to the environment and while having fun.
      <br> <br>
      My role in this project was a UX designer and researcher. I contributed 
      to creating surveys and analyzing the data, performing literature review and 
      researching the competitive space, and creating high fidelity prototypes.

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text emphasized-text">
      Imagine...
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      You want to attend a music festival with your friends!
    </div>
    <br>

    <div class="body-text emphasized-text">
      But...
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      <ol>
        <li>You don't want to spend money.
          <br>
          You're a broke college student, or you want to spend money on other important 
          things. Music festival spending is not in your budget.
        </li>

        <li>Festivals are typically bad for the environment. 
          <br>
          This is because of air pollution, energy consumption, congested roads, etc. 
          (Weston et al., 2015). They also often rely on cheaper exploitative labor to 
          clean up after. 
        </li>

        <li>Cheap tickets are hard to find. 
          <br>
          Yes, there might be one-day passes that are significantly cheaper, but you l
          ove the lineup so much that you want to attend all 3 days of the festival. Or, 
          you're traveling far and have to pay for housing and a plane ticket, so you might 
          as well attend all festival days. 
        </li>

        <li>Sometimes it isn't easy to find people to go with. 
          <br>
          The social aspect is the key motivating factor for engaging in leisure activities 
          like attending music festivals. (O'Neill & Egermann, 2022). You also might have 
          friends who are going and you don't want to have FOMO (fear of missing out).
        </li>
      </ol>
     
    </div>

    <br> <br>


    <div class="body-text">
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      To enhance accessibility to attend music festivals while promoting sustainability 
      and fostering social interactions at these events, we created TicketTasker. 
      TicketTasker is an app that allows you to <span class="highlight-text">volunteer at music festivals with 
      friends or by yourself in exchange for free tickets.</span>
