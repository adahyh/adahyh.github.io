      <h2>Overview</h2>
      This project was made for COGS 123: Social Computing, a course at UC San Diego. 
      My team and I sought to explore the intersection between social behavior and 
      computational systems. This was done through creating a social computing 
      experience that the students could participate in, and we decided to create 
      TicketTasker: a way to bring together music festival volunteers who might 
      attend by themselves, and hope to make friends with like-minded individuals 
      who want to give back to the environment and while having fun.
      <br> <br>
      My role in this project was a UX designer and researcher. I contributed 
      to creating surveys and analyzing the data, performing literature review and 
      researching the competitive space, and creating high fidelity prototypes.

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text emphasized-text">
      Imagine...
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      You want to attend a music festival with your friends!
    </div>
    <br>

    <div class="body-text emphasized-text">
      But...
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      <ol>
        <b>
        <li>You don't want to spend money. </b>
          <br>
          You're a broke college student, or you want to spend money on other important 
          things. Music festival spending is not in your budget.
        </li>

        <b>
        <li>Festivals are typically bad for the environment. </b>
          <br>
          This is because of air pollution, energy consumption, congested roads, etc. 
          (Weston et al., 2015). They also often rely on cheaper exploitative labor to 
          clean up after. 
        </li>

        <b>
        <li>Cheap tickets are hard to find. </b>
          <br>
          Yes, there might be one-day passes that are significantly cheaper, but you l
          ove the lineup so much that you want to attend all 3 days of the festival. Or, 
          you're traveling far and have to pay for housing and a plane ticket, so you might 
          as well attend all festival days. 
        </li>

        <b>
        <li>Sometimes it isn't easy to find people to go with. </b>
          <br>
          The social aspect is the key motivating factor for engaging in leisure activities 
          like attending music festivals. (O'Neill & Egermann, 2022). You also might have 
          friends who are going and you don't want to have FOMO (fear of missing out).
        </li>

    <div class="body-text">
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      To enhance accessibility to attend music festivals while promoting sustainability 
      and fostering social interactions at these events, we created TicketTasker. 
      TicketTasker is an app that allows you to <b>volunteer at music festivals with 
      friends or by yourself in exchange for free tickets.</b>

            <b>Homepage:</b> <br>
            Available music festivals are listed by their event tier. Based on responses 
            from our prototyping session, users were motivated by the gamification aspects 
            of the app. We made sure to continue incorporating these aspects through 
            presenting, but keeping higher tier events locked.
            <br>

            <b>My Events:</b> <br>
            Users can view the events that they have signed up to volunteer at. 
            <br>

            <b>Messages:</b> <br>
            Users can message one another to get to know each other or find friends to 
            attend the festival or volunteer with.
            <br>

            <b>My Account:</b> <br>
            A profile page for the user, with information such as their name, rating, and 
            social media which can be viewed by other volunteers and task organizers. The 
            user can access their personal information such as favorited events, past 
            reviews by task organizers, and their deposit.

      Event Sign-Up & Sharing
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      Users can select an event on the homepage, which will lead them to the event 
      specific page where they can view information including a description, past 
      ratings by other volunteers, and the event attendees. From there, they can 
      sign up for the event, which involves choosing their shift time and volunteer 
      task, filling out personal information, and placing their deposit. 
      <br><br>
      While we hope to flesh out a feature in the future that allows people to see 
      which of their friends sign up for events directly on the sign-up page, we 
      currently have a feature that allows friends to share in the app or on iMessage 
      after they sign up for an event. Our hope is that this feature will encourage 
      more people to engage with the app or download it if they receive a link from 
      a friend encouraging them to sign up together.

        <div class="col-md-8">
          After arriving at the event, users are given the option to check-in on the 
          event page. From there, their app will open a camera where they can scan 
          the check-in QR code that the organizer will present. The check-out process 
          is identical, but users will instead select check-out.

        <div class="col-md-8">
          Once the event starts, the Task Organizer receives a QR code. This is presented 
          to volunteers to scan so that they can be checked-in to the event. The same 
          process is done for checking-out. Task Organizers are also given the option 
          to view all volunteers, which can be sorted by their task and shift time. 
          This presents information on the volunteer such as their check-in/check-out 
          times, their entire volunteer schedule, and a place to rate the volunteer.

      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    </div>
    <br>

    <div class="body-text">
      Our aim was to develop a mobile app that cultivates a social computing atmosphere 
      encompassing the phases before, during, and after attending a music festival. 
      Through our research, we recognized that crafting distinctive social interactions 
      within the context of music festivals necessitates continuous iterations and 
      feedback to discern what drives users to engage with our app. We prioritized 
      implementing reward systems and gamification while consciously avoiding exploitative 
      social computing strategies. Our aspiration is for our social media application to 
      facilitate online communication, transitioning plans from group chats into real-life 
      experiences, thus motivating individuals to actively embrace offline living. Some of 
      the next steps we hope to see in the next phase of our app are:

    <br><br>

    <div class="body-text sub-header">
      Fleshing Out & Adding More Features 
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      We would hope to flesh out the volunteer and task organizer review system a bit 
      more, especially with the appeal process for a bad review, the check out process for 
      users, and we'd want to find a way to highlight when prospective volunteers' friends 
      are volunteering when they're signing up. We'd also try and figure out a way for users 
      to be held accountable without having to “pay” for a ticket. 
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <div class="body-text sub-header">
      Further the Gamification Aspect 
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      In the future, we would also like to further develop the gamification aspect, where 
      different tasks earn more points. For example, less desirable tasks such as trash 
      pickup can offer more points to incentivize users to sign up for these unwanted tasks. 
      We would also love to show people what tier their friends are at and highlight exclusive 
      opportunities that come with different tiers to encourage healthy competition.
