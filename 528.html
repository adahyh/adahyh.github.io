      <h2>Overview</h2>
        528 Entertainment is a studio specializing in DIY workshops, with a reputation for their 
        popular tufting sessions whre customers design and craft custom rugs. This service is popular 
        amongst young adults, couples, and friend groups seeking a fun, unique activity. 
        <br>
        As a UX designer on this client project, I was tasked with redesigning the website to better showcase 
        their offerings and build a stronger connection with their community. 
        <br><br>
        This case study is an ongoing WIP!
    </div>
    <br> <br>

    <!-- problem section -->
    <div class="body-text">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
        528 Entertainment had a website, but it was not informative in its business offerings, 
        causing users to face difficulty when completing the booking process. While it displayed their services, 
        it lacked the visual appeal to draw in its customers and showcase what they would get out of their experience. 
        <br><br>
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
          <div class="col-lg-12">

          </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        While meeting with the client, we created the a priority list of following goals: 
        <ol>
          <li>Showcase the experience to differentiate from competitors</li>
          <li>Communicate different offerings and generate more interest in them </li>
          <li>Have a clear booking experience</li>
          <li>Obtain user-generated content photos and videos taken by customers</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
  
    <br> <br>

    <!-- solution section -->
    <div class="body-text">
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      To address the lack of clarity and visual engagement, I redesigned the website with 
      a visual-first approach. Branding was refreshed to appeal to younger audiences by introducing 
      playful colors, bold typography, and images. The site architecture was reorganized to present 
      each service as a journey rather than a transactional offering, guiding users step by step 
      through what to expect.
      <br>
      Clear and consistent calls to action were added to simplify booking, and visual aids were created 
      to help users understand sizing, design options, and the creative process. Social proof elements 
      including real customer photos and a gallery were incorporated to inspire participation and 
      encourage user-generated content.

      Selling an Experience, Not Just a Service
    </div>
    <div class="body-text">
      One of the biggest challenges was helping users understand that they were not just 
      booking a workshop, but a full creative experience. Tufting, in particular, has many 
      interactive steps but the original website presented it in a flat, transactional way. 
      My goal was to shift this perception by breaking the service into steps that reflected 
      the fun, hands-on nature of the process. Through playful visuals, immersive imagery, and 
      storytelling, the website gave users a sense of what to expect and why it would be memorable.

      Explaining Visually, not Verbally
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      Another challenge was educating users about things they could not easily imagine, 
      like what 21 inches looks like in real life, or what kinds of designs work best 
      for tufting. Instead of overloading users with text, I leaned on <strong>visual explanations. </strong>
      I created design guidelines using <strong>comparison images, embedded example works, and 
      helpful callouts to clarify concepts.</strong> This helped reduce confusion, especially 
      for users who were new to tufting or wanted resassurance.
      <br><br>

      <strong>This was done through:</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Images showing the tools and process</li>
        <li>Concrete examples and comparisons</li>
        <li>Showing size in reference to other options</li>

          After the user selects a service they are interested in, they are directed to a page 
          to showcase the full experience. Rather than just providing information, the page is structured
          to guide the user through each part of the process with engaging visuals. This helps users 
          understand what to expect, and makes the service feel more tangible.
          <br><br>
          The goal of this page is not just inform, but to immerse the user in the experience of the 
          service they are viewing. The aim is to <strong>help users envision themselves participating 
          through showcasing each of the process.</strong> The shift from booking an activity to becoming immersed 
          in an experience was key to driving conversions and spurring users into action. 

          <br><br>
          To help users navigate the page, there are  buttons which will scroll to its respective section.

    <div class="body-text">
      When exploring services, there was limited visual information and unclear descriptions to guide 
      decision-making. Selecting a service would immediately lead to the scheduling page, disrupting the user's 
      mental model. Users typically expect to see more detailed information or a description before committing 
      to a booking, especially if the descriptions were truncated or did not provide full context.

      <h2>Final Takeaways</h2>
      This project reinforced the reality that designing a website is an iterative process. 
      I went through multiple rounds of refinement, adapting our prototype based on 
      usability tests, client input, and our own observations. I learned that setting clear 
      goals early and aligning with both the client and team members is essential to avoid 
      missteps later.
      <br><br>
      Planning ahead with mini deadlines, regular check-ins, and shared priorities kept the project 
      moving forward despite differing schedules. I also deepened my understanding of how to 
      translate a brand's personality into a functional design, balancing aesthetics with usability.
      <br><br>
      One of the biggest lessons was that while client direction is important, designers should feel 
      empowered to take initiative. Presenting thoughtful solutions, even before being asked, can speed 
      up progress and often helps clients clarify what they really want. This experience strengthened my 
      technical and collaborative skills and sharpened my ability to capture a brand's voice while delivering 
      a clear and user-friendly digital experience.
