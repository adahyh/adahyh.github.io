      <h2>Overview</h2>
      My team and I designed a prototype of an extension for digital audio workspaces (DAWs), such as Pro Tools. 
      This extension could allow clients and audio engineers to asynchronously provide time-stamped, specific 
      feedback on tracks and compile editing history, critiques, and comments in one place. 
      Our prototype integrates client feedback directly into digital audio workspaces (DAWs) like Pro Tools. 
      By introducing time-stamped annotations, revision tracking, and contextual commenting, we created a unified 
      workspace where feedback lives exactly where it belongs&mdash; with the audio itself. Engineers and clients can 
      point precisely to what they're discussing, creating a visual conversation around sound.

    <!-- problem section -->
    <div class="body-text">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      The lack of integrated communication within DAWs, exacerbated by the shift to asynchronous studio and music 
      editing post-pandemic, forces engineers and clients to exchange feedback through text which makes it 
      difficult to correlate feedback with specific audio content.

    </div>
    <br>


    <!-- solution section -->
    <div class="body-text">
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      Audio engineers and remote music producers need a quick way to access and edit audio files to 
      maintain momentum during work sessions and demonstrate progress to their clients. Additionally, 
      collaboration with clients like bands can lead to conflicting feedback, which makes it difficult 
      to refine the audio. These obstacles create friction in the workflow, hindering both creativity 
      and productivity. Enabling easier feedback processes could help to prevent burnout or frustration 
      and stress especially for amateaur audio engineers or artists.

      <div class="sub-header">
        1. How can we reduce time spent on manual processes?
      </div>

      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-lg-10">
            <img src="images/daw/comment-view.png" alt="before and after of comment menu" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
      </div>
      <br>
      Comments appear directly on the timeline according to where they are referencing. This was inspired by 
      Soundcloud's comments, which appear as the song play. This allows the engineer to easily see 
      what and where the feedback is about, without having to refer to their external notes. 
      <br><br>
      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <img src="images/daw/soundcloud.png" alt="soundcloud comments" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
      </div>
      <br>
      Comments are written in a journaling format, with the ability to insert time references, 
      reference songs, or an audio recording. This puts all features in one spot so artists can focus on using one platform. 
      <br><br>

     <b> User research findings</b> 
      <ul>
        <li>Users referred back between tracks or would select mute or solo features which would 
          mistakenly open the comment menu, which was triggered by hovering on the bottom 
          &rarr; comment menu was changed to a click to open</li>
        <li>While users valued the comments synced with the timeline, it was less helpful for an overview 
          &rarr; allow a sidebar list view of all comments so they can easily scroll and click to get to where it references in the timeline</li>
        <li>Users were confused by which comments referenced what part of the track specifically &rarr; 
          comment structure emphasizes time it references and the specific instrument</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Result:</b> Allowing time links between comments and the track prevents manual note-taking 
        that needs to be referred to throughout the editing process. Separating comment features 
        from the rest of the tracks prevents confusion due to content shift and misclicks. 
      <br><br>

      <div class="sub-header">
          2. How can we facilitate constructive feedback?
      </div>

      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-lg-10">
            <img src="images/daw/reference-view.png" alt="before and after of reference menu" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
      </div>
      <br>
      Reference tracks provide a concrete way for artists to describe the sound that 
      they want to replicate. This is especially important in an asynchronous environment, 
      where both parties cannot easily have a back and forth or make quick edits in attempt 
      to recreate an idea. 
      <br>
      Inserting a reference track into a comment allows artists to be specific in what they 
      want, rather than giving a comment that may be unclear or abstract such as "this part sounds too flat".
      This helps engineers know exactly what to target and recreate. 
      <br><br>
     <b> User research findings</b> 
      <ul>
        <li>Users preferred to have features hidden until needed &rarr; change menu access location to the comment box, rather than hovering on the right</li>
      </ul>

      <b>Result:</b> The workspace was cleaner and more flexible which maximized screen space for the tracks. 
      <br><br>

      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-lg-10">
            <img src="images/daw/reference-song.png" alt="reference song selection" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
      </div>
      <br>
      After the reference song has been selected, the part of the song which the artist is interested in can be selected. 
      When the comment is posted, it can be played by others viewing the file. 
      <br><br>


      <div class="sub-header">
          3. How can engineers get an overview of the client's feedback?
      </div>

      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-lg-10">
            <img src="images/daw/heatmap-view.png" alt="before and after of heatmap menu" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
      </div>
      <br>
      A heat map is created as artists listen, keeping track of the replays and pauses. 
      This provides an overview and visual representation of what areas were of interest and why. 
      <br>
      Inserting a reference track into a comment allows artists to be specific in what they 
      want, rather than giving a comment that may be unclear or abstract such as "this part sounds too flat".
      This helps engineers know exactly what to target and recreate. 
      <br><br>
     <b> User research findings</b> 
      <ul>
        <li>The curved representation did not provide a clear idea of the artists' playback </li>
        &rarr; change from a polynomial representation to vertical bars  
      </ul>
      <b>Result:</b> Each bar correlates to start or pause data from the user which gives a more exact picture
       on how clients are interacting with the track. 
      <br><br>

      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <img src="images/daw/youtube.png" alt="youtube most replayed" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
      </div>
      <br>

      This was inspired by Youtube's "most replayed feature", but the polynomial curve makes sense 
      for the large user base, where replays occur frequently at different times. Between engineers 
      and their clients, data is only summarized between a few users. User testing showed that users 
      often replay sections lasting 5-10 seconds before pausing. A uniform distribution frequency graph
      better helps engineers understand continuous playback of specific blocks or periods.

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    </div>
    <br>

    <div class="body-text">
      Going into this project, I had no experience with working with DAWs or music editing, 
      aside from using GarageBand to make a custom ringtone (if that even counts). Because of this, 
      it was especially important for me to rely on the insights and experiences of users 
      in order to guide the design process.
      <br><br>
    
      This project taught me how powerful user interviews could be to uncover insights 
      through thoughtful, probing questions. One of our interviewees had been an audio 
      engineer for over 30 years. His workflow was already well-established, so at first it was 
      challenging to get beyond his practiced routines. But by asking follow-up questions and encouraging 
      reflection on both positive and negative experiences, we were able to find potential areas of improvement 
      that were not immediately obvious.
      <br><br>

      Overall, this experience reinforced how important it is to approach research with curiosity, 
      especially when designing for a user group outside your own expertise. It also showed me that 
      even the most experienced users still have moments of friction, and those moments are often 
      where the most meaningful design opportunities lie.
